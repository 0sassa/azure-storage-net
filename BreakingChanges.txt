- maxResults while listing queues in nullable now.

- The BlobTypeMismatch and ExtendedErrorUnavailable error strings have changed in SR.cs.

- OperationContext.RequestResults does not expose a setter anymore.

- Renamed CloudQueue.EndBeginClear(IAsyncResult) to CloudQueue.EndClear(IAsyncResult).

- StreamExtensions.WriteToSync<T>(Stream, Stream, long?, long? bool, bool, ExecutionState<T>, StreamDescriptor) now throws InvalidOperationException(SR.StreamLengthError) instead of ArgumentOutOfRangeException("stream").

- StreamExtensions.WriteToAsync<T>(stream, Stream, long?, long?, bool, ExecutionState<T>, StreamDescriptor, CancellationToken token) now throws InvalidOperationException(SR.StreamLengthError) instead of ArgumentOutOfRangeException("stream").

- The StorageException thrown when an operation is cancelled now includes an OperationCanceledException as its inner exception.

Tracking Breaking Changes since 2.1 RTM

- When DataServiceContext is used to execute table operations, response received event on OperationContext is no longer fired.

- ContinuationTokens are written with an additional <ContinuationToken> element enclosing them if WriteXml() method is used - ReadXml() parser is updated to handle this.

- Only the ServiceProperties that are provided are changed. In previous REST versions ommitting a properties section such as Metrics would result in those settings being removed by the service.

- Please refer to the blog post about Breaking Changes on the server side in the new storage protocol version(2013-08-15) here:
